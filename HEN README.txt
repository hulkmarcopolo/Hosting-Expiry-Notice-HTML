# Hosting Expiry Notice

This README file provides information on how to use and customize the "Hosting Expiry Notice" web page template.

## Overview

The "Hosting Expiry Notice" is a simple web page designed to inform website administrators about the expiration of their hosting services. It includes a countdown timer to indicate the time remaining until the hosting expires.

## Usage

To use this template, follow these steps:

1. **HTML Structure:** The HTML structure of the template is provided in the code you've shared. You can copy and paste this code into an HTML file or integrate it into your website.

2. **Customization:** Customize the template to fit your needs:

   - **Title:** You can change the title of the page by modifying the `<title>` tag inside the `<head>` section.

   - **Logo:** Replace the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag with the path to your own logo.

   - **Recipient's Name:** Replace "Dear Topice Consulting Admin" in the `<h1>` tag with the name of the recipient.

   - **Expiration Date:** Update the `const countDownDate` in the JavaScript section with your desired expiration date and time.

   - **Expiration Notice:** Modify the content inside the `<div class="expiration-notice">` to provide specific information about the hosting expiration.

## Countdown Timer

The countdown timer is implemented using JavaScript. It calculates the time remaining until the specified expiration date and updates the displayed countdown every second. When the countdown reaches zero, it hides the countdown timer and displays the expiration notice.
